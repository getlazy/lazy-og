# lazy-reducer-engine
Engine that reduces the number of warnings generated by other lazy engines.

This engine can be placed anywhere in engine pipeline, usually as the last one in sequence of engines. It will take the output of previous engine and reduce the number of reported warnings by:

- Shrinking all warnings with the same rule-id into a single warning with that rule-id. This will only happen for rules that have more than `maxWarningsPerRule` occurences. 
- Trim the total number of warnings to `maxWarningsPerFile`

The two parameters should be configured in engine_pipeline section of lazy.yaml. For example:
````
engine_pipeline:
  batch:
    - file-stats: 
    - sequence:
      - github-access: 
      - pullreq: 
    - sequence:
      - batch:
        - emcc: 
        - css: 
        - html: 
        - eslint: 
        - yaml: 
        - stylelint: 
        - php-l: 
        - pmd-java: 
        - tidy-html: 
      - postp: 
      - reducer: 
          maxWarningsPerRule: 5     # allow up to 5 warnings for same rule-id
          maxWarningsPerFile: 150   # allow up to 150 warnings per file
````

Default values are :

`maxWarningsPerRule = 4`

`maxWarningsPerFile = 200`
